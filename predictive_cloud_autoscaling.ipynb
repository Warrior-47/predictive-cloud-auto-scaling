    "Cloud based systems have varying load throughout the day. The time of day, the day of the month, the time of year, some or all might play a role in the amount of load being put on the system. Therefore, it is crucial to have the necessary number of servers/virtual machine (VM) instances/Kubernetes pods to ensure service availability and better response times. However, it can hard and tedious to understand what is the appropriate number instances a system should have at a specific time. You also have to consider that having a high number of instances during idle time can drive up cost."
